\chapter{Introduction}
Predictions of the grawitational wave signal from early Universe cosmoliogical phase trnsition 
depend on the shape of effective potential of the theory. 
In this thesis we will investigate how 


\section{Toy model}

For a toy model we choose theory described by the Lagransian:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+D_\mu\Phi D^\mu\Phi^\dag-\lambda\Phi^4,
\end{equation}
where $\Phi$ is a comlex scalar field and the vector field present is $U(1)$ gauge boson. \\

%There will be also version included for comparision, with the mass term explicitly present:
%\begin{equation}
%\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+D_\mu\Phi D^\mu\Phi^\dag-m^2\Phi^2-\lambda\Phi^4,
%\end{equation}
%The $\cl$, $\cm$ are numerical constants equal to, respectively, $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ 
%throught the thesis if not stated otherwise. \\

Writing operator $D$ more explicitly it reads:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+(\partial_\mu\Phi + ieA_\mu\Phi) 
(\partial^\mu\Phi^\dag-ieA^\mu\Phi^\dag)-\lambda\Phi^4,
\end{equation}

For the reasons that will be clear in \ref{} we will write $\Phi$ field as two real scalar fields 
$\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$, such that:
\begin{equation}
\Phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\varphi_1+\varphi_2)
\end{equation}
Then Lagransian take form:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+ \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\varphi_1 - eA_\mu\varphi_2)
(\partial^\mu\varphi_1 - eA^\mu\varphi_2)  \\
+\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\varphi_2+eA_\mu\varphi_1)(\partial^\mu\varphi_2+eA^\mu\varphi_1) 
-\frac{1}{4}\lambda(\varphi_1^2+\varphi_2^2)^2,\notag
\end{align}
which we will write for brevity as:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+ 
\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\varphi_1 - eA_\mu\varphi_2)^2\\
+\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\varphi_2+eA_\mu\varphi_1)^2
-\frac{1}{4}\lambda(\varphi_1^2+\varphi_2^2)^2. \notag
\end{align}

For a better track of what is independent of numerical convention, we will also write:
\begin{align}\label{toy_model}
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+ 
\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\varphi_1 - eA_\mu\varphi_2)^2\\
+\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\varphi_2+eA_\mu\varphi_1)^2
-\cl\lambda(\varphi_1^2+\varphi_2^2)^2, \notag
\end{align}
but $\cl = \frac{1}{4}$ everywhere in the thesis if not stated otherwise.
